# csharp-objects-treehouse

This project follows along with the Treehouse course on object oriented programming in C#, which is intended to teach the basics of OOP and expose students to most of the syntax of C#. It builds a simple tower defence game where invaders march down a path and the user can place towers to shoot the invaders.
